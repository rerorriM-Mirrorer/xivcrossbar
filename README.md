# XIVCrossbar (Enhanced Fork)

The `work/consolidate-2026-10-04` branch is our consolidation of the reported
working October 4 installation and later Lua fixes, based on qEagleStrikerp's
fork. Build `0.4.0-a.20261004.1` awaits the next live test; master is unchanged.
See the [capture and comparison](docs/CONSOLIDATION-2026-10-04.md),
[short test/rollback instructions](docs/TESTING-2026-10-04.md),
[dependencies](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md) and [GitHub access](docs/GITHUB-ACCESS.md).
Contributing author for our local changes: **A**. Original credits follow.

A Windower 4 addon that emulates Final Fantasy XIV's controller crossbar UI for FFXI.

This is an enhanced fork of [AliekberFFXI's xivcrossbar](https://github.com/AliekberFFXI/xivcrossbar) (originally based on SirEdeonX's xivhotbar) with several additions to the configuration UI, new combat indicators, custom action support, and many quality-of-life improvements.

A huge thank you to GrayFox for significantly enhancing the Readme.

Important TODOs for this Readme:
(1) Expand the `Settings Reference` section so it covers all available settings.

## Setup 

### Coming from another Version of XivCrossbar

1. Backup your xivcrossbar folder just in case (zip it, or move it ouside the windower\addons folder).

2. Download this repo, throw all contents into your new `xivcrossbar` folder inside windower\addons. (A replace all *should* be fine, but better if you start from scratch)

3. Copy over the `data` folder from your previous version. If you had custom images, then copy those as well into the images folder as needed. (not needed if you decided to just replace all)

4. On next load, missing settings will be added to your settings file, and any new xmls (custom actions, shared icons) will be created as well. Your job xmls will update to the new style (hotbar_ll, slot_du, etc) when they get recreated (on modification), but nothing should get lost.

### First Time Setup

1. 
    a) Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (v1).

    If you get an error with the `ffxi_input.ahk` when it tries to run, search for AutoHotKey Dash in your start menu, go into launch settings, and set to run all scripts with a specific interpreter, then point to `AutoHotKeyU64.exe` inside Program Files and whatever v1 version you're using. 

    **OR** (for Steam Deck users)

    b) Add the following line to your init.txt Windower script, changing the path as appropriate to point to your FFXI_Input.sh:

    run C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe /c start /unix /home/deck/Games/final-fantasy-xi-online/FFXI_Input.sh

2. Enable the **Run** plugin in Windower.

3. In the Gamepad configuration tool for FFXI, make sure to leave `Select / Confirm`, `Cancel`, `Active Window / Window Options`, `Main Menu` and both `Macro Palette` unbound. These will be handled by the AutoHotKey script and the addon. Any other settings (`Autorun`, `Heal / Lock Target`) bind as you wish, just obviously don't re-use the face buttons and triggers. You can compare your setup with the `ConfigureYourGamepadLikeThis.jpg` file in this repo. Green box = required to have set, Red box = required to leave blank, Yellow box = configure it the way you usually do.

4. In your `windower\scripts\init.txt` include the following line at the end:
    ```
    lua load xivcrossbar
    ```

5. Follow the in-game setup dialog. This should run automatically on first load, or with `//xivcrossbar setup`. 
   - **XInput controllers**: should work naturally (either if the device is XInput by default or with an emulation layer from software like DS4Windows, etc)
   - **Other DirectInput controllers**: you may need to edit button numbers in `ffxi_directinput.ahk`. Use the [JoystickTest](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs_1.0/scripts/JoystickTest.htm) script to find your button numbers, then change lines like `Joy10::` to `Joy4::` (and corresponding `GetKeyState` lines). And I can not help you here.
   - Note that **DirectInput script is disabled by default** — just to avoid any issues with both scripts running together. If you're using DirectInput, you can enable it by editing your `data/settings.xml` and setting `use_directinput` to `false` and `use_xinput` to `true`.

6. **Minus / Share / Back** opens and closes the action binder utility.

7. **Plus / Options / Start** brings up the crossbar set selector while held; use the d-pad to switch sets.

8. Once comfortable with button placement, consider enabling Compact Mode by setting `iscompact` to `true` in your `data/settings.xml` to reclaim screen space.

9. If you want extra clusters in a given set, you can set `hotbar_number` in the settings to 4 or 6. Setting to 4 will enable the clusters by holding both triggers one after the other (`R > L` = 3 / RL, `L > R` = 4 / LR). Setting to 6 will also enable the clusters triggered by double-tapping a trigger (L twice = 5 / LL, R twice 6 / RR). Note that when using Hotbars 5 and 6, it is highly recommended to set `AutoHideExtraBars` to true as well. This will hide extra bars 5 & 6 until you double-tap `LT` or `RT` (Credit goes to BlueSummersC). Your `data/settings.xml` should look something like this:

    ```xml
    <settings>
        <global>
            <!-- ... -->
            <AutoHideExtraBars>true</AutoHideExtraBars>
            <Hotbar>
                <!-- ... -->
                <Number>6</Number>
            </Hotbar>
            <!-- ... -->
        </global>
    </settings>
    ```

## Optional settings

### Spell, Weaponskill, and Job Ability Lockout Bars (by grayfox2510)
This is a single visible "cooldown" bar that shows below the crossbar depending on what action you performed:

- **Spell lockout** — bluish-white during the bulk of the lockout, flashes a different color in the final ~15% of the time set. The default duration is 3.0 seconds (roughly the estimated lockout period, but seems to have a very small variance). This is purely to represent the period where you can NOT cast another spell. You can modify the duration to your liking in the setting `SpellLockoutIndicator.Duration`.
- **Weaponskill lockout** — 2.0 seconds, amber. During this period you can't really do anything else, and your auto-attack is also paused.
- **Job Ability lockout** — 2.0 seconds, red for the first 1.0s (full lockout) then green (you can perform another JA, WS or a spell at this point). Auto-attacks are paused for the whole 2 seconds, hence the distinction.

Each bar has its own settings group where you can modify the colors used, and an `Opacity` field. **Setting any indicator's `Opacity` to 0 hides just that bar** but leaves the other ones alone.

Setting Groups: `SpellLockoutIndicator`, `WeaponskillLockoutIndicator`, `JobAbilityLockoutIndicator`.

### Auto-Attack Swing Timer (by grayfox2510)
A... very experimental setting. This was more of a "what happens if I do this?" and is by no means really meant to be taken seriously. But it's fun to watch sometimes. 
This bar sits right above the lockout bars from above, and it estimates your weapon swing delay from a rolling average of the most recent 10 swings. There's still some internal variance, so it's never *quite* exact. Divided in two segments of red/green of the calculated delay and the expected time to swing.

Shown only when engaged (weapon out).

Pauses automatically on:
- Weaponskills and Job Abilities (2-second freeze)
- Disabling debuffs: Sleep, Petrify, Stun, Terror, Charm

Settings: `AutoAttackIndicator`. Disabled by default due to its experimental nature, if you want to toy with it, just set `Opacity` to any value higher than 0. (220 is the default value for the other bars)

### Custom Actions (by grayfox2510)
Editing XMLs not your thing? Got you covered. 
You can create `ex` actions from inside the game. Gearswap commands, other mods, whatever. Anything that you would send to the game with a windower command (`//`). Stored per-character in `CustomActions.xml`. These saved actions are job-agnostic. Any custom action you create will show up on the binder for you to assign to any slot of any job. 

If you do like editing XMLs, you can do that too. Just copy/paste a block and go at it.

Each entry has:
- **Alias** — what's shown when you bind the action to a crossbar
- **Name** — a unique name shown on the action binder, also acts as a unique key (i.e., no duplicates)
- **Command** — the raw Windower command that fires when the slot is pressed (**don't** include `//`)
- **Icon** (optional) — pulled from the active iconpack
- **Linked metadata** (optional) — borrow MP/TP cost, recast, and element from a real spell or job ability so the slot displays cost and recast indicators just like a native action, neat if you're using gearswap commands to act as specific spells/JAs/WSs for whatever reason

Quick creation: `//xb ca new <alias> [name]` jumps directly to editable review with a blank command and optional icon/linked metadata. If name is omitted it equals alias. Set the command with `//xb ca c <command>`, then choose **Save & Bind** to go straight to a button combo or **Save Only** to add it to the catalog. Empty saved commands do nothing.

Manage custom actions through the in-game binder:
- **Create Custom Action** — wizard that walks you through the process: alias → name → command → icon → linked action → save
- **Edit Custom Action** — single review screen showing all fields, with options to revise text fields via chat command or pick new icon / linked action
- **Delete Custom Action** — picker → confirm

The text fields (alias, name, command) are entered via chat commands during the create or edit flow as prompted by the process:

```
//xcb ca a <alias>
//xcb ca n <name>
//xcb ca c <command>
```

Typing directly into the window (my first attempt) would "bleed" the keybinds to the game. Meaning you would move, sit, start typing in chat as well, etc. It was too confusing/annoying. There were also some other limitations with accepted characters that I didn't want to deal with. 

Edits refresh exact old command/alias matches in the currently loaded job and shared layers. Other job files retain their saved command snapshots until rebound. Delete still requires manually removing existing bindings. `//xb ca debug on` records selector state, selected option and exception stacks in the Windower console.

See [Global and Local Icon Overrides](#global-and-local-icon-overrides) below for more info regarding the icon selection process.

### Quick XB Switch (by grayfox2510)
A new binder action type that creates a one-shot temporary crossbar switch — pressing the slot swaps to another set, and the next non-switch action you fire automatically reverts to the original. If you "chain" multiple of these it will go back to the very first one at the end.

The main difference between this and the original **Switch Crossbars** is just if you want to permanently switch into that set, or for a quick one-off. Useful for cleaner song, roll, whatever grouping without cluttering your "default" with your most common actions.

Shown in the action binder as "Quick XB Switch."

For those who like editing XMLs: `<type>switch</type>` with `<action>` set to the target set's kebab-cased name.

### Shared Environment (by grayfox2510)
A 4th pinned crossbar set (alongside Default, Job-Default, and All-Jobs-Default) that's selectable like a regular set but **never participates in the icon-fallback chain**. Meaning, normally your current crossbar is a combination of the "default" sets with whatever you have in your active set, with the ones lower on the chain taking priority.

This bar sits completely on its own, and the actions shown there are only the ones you set there. Useful for character-wide commands (mounts, trusts, job change addon macros, common items, etc.) that you want available on every job without cluttering your actual sets. 

Stored per-character in `Shared.xml`.

Setting: `UseSharedSet` (default true). If you don't want to use it, just set to false.

### Global and Local Icon Overrides (by grayfox2510)
Two new options in the action binder: **Change Icon** and **Global Icon Set**.

Change Icon allows you to select an action on your bar, and then use an in-game "explorer" to walk through your iconpack and select a new icon for it. This is the same as going to the specific job xml and editing the `<icon>` tag in that action.

Global Icon Set is the same process, but saves the values to `SharedIcons.xml` to persist across sets. Basically, if you like to use a specific image for a given spell, you can use this to avoid messing with the default data. 

The order of priority for solving which icon to show is the individual action (in your job xml), then the shared icons one, and finally whatever is the default in the addon.

You might notice a command window popping up for a flash when navigating through the folders. In order to get the folders/images and list them, this information is obtained through a simple command prompt:

- `dir /b /a:d "<full_path>" 2>nul`
- `dir /b /a:-d "<full_path>\*.png" 2>nul`

The full path is whatever is being accumulated as you go down folders, starting from the iconpack set in settings. The rest of the settings boil down to simply getting the names with no extra data, include/exclude subfolders (as necessary), and so on. The two commands are because folders and images need to be handled separately for rendering/logic reasons.

### Readable XML Names (by grayfox2510)
If you don't mind editing XML files, the original addon used numbers to reference the clusters and icons and yes, you can memorize the order. But why do that when you can instead make them more readable?

- **Hotbars**: `hotbar_l`, `hotbar_r`, `hotbar_rl`, `hotbar_lr`, `hotbar_ll`, `hotbar_rr` (the trigger sequence that activates each)
- **Slots**: `slot_ll`, `slot_ld`, `slot_lr`, `slot_lu` (left cluster — d-pad), `slot_rl`, `slot_rd`, `slot_rr`, `slot_ru` (right cluster — face buttons)

This is a pure boundary translation — internal data structures are unchanged. Just makes editing the XMLs by hand a bit easier. If you are coming from another version of XivCrossbar, you don't need to worry about losing any data, everything will be ported over seamlessly. That being said, it's a one-way street. Make a backup of your data/hotbar folder first, in case you want to go back to another version. 

### In-Game Binder Enhancements (by grayfox2510)
The configuration UI accessible via Minus/Share/Back gained several new top-level entries:

- **Change Icon** — replace the icon of an already-bound slot
- **Global Icon Set** — write a `SharedIcons.xml` entry from a slot's alias
- **Create / Edit / Delete Custom Action** — full management of `CustomActions.xml`
- **Quick XB Switch** — bind a one-shot temp-switch slot

Extras:
- **Trigger paging** — in any selector, L2-then-R2 = next page, R2-then-L2 = previous page
- **Instant Start menu hide** — when manually moving to another set, the window immediately closes when you let go off start
- **Saved offsets respected** — `<OffsetX>` / `<OffsetY>` in settings.xml are honored on reload

### Alternative Xinput AHK script for `R1` Hotbar Switching (by qEagleStrikerp)
Added an alternative version of the Xinput AHK script that uses `R1` instead of `START` for switching crossbars, just like in FFXIV. You can find it under `/ahks`. Note that you have to replace the original `ffxi_xinput.ahk` with it for it to work.

### Magic Burst UI (by qEagleStrikerp)
Changed the UI to highlight spells and abilities that are eligible for Magic Bursts. Whenever a Skillchain is formed, the corresponding actions will be highlighted if able to Magic Burst. This also considers BLU's Azure Lore / Chain Affinity / Burst Affinity, SCH's Immanence, DRG's Smiting Breath and RUN's Swipe / Lunge. I haven't tested BRD, NIN and BST yet, so if something doesn't work, please open up a new Github Issue.

![Magic Burst](readme_images/magic_burst.png?raw=true "Magic Burst")

### Alternate FFXIV Button Layout (by BlueSummersC)
Added an Alternate Layout (setting: `UseAltLayout`) that mimics FFXIV's alt layout, where the left side will always be dpad and right side will be face buttons. Note: This makes editing the xmls a litte more confusing, as it alternates what is shows. For example, from left to right on your screen you will now see hotbar_1 slots 1-4, then hotbar_2 slots 1-4, then hotbar_1 slots 5-8 and finally hotbar_2 slots 5-8. Keep that in mind if manually editing the xmls.

### More AHK Scripts for Logitech F710, Flight Pad Pro and PS5 Controller (by Icydeath)
Added new AHK files for Logitech F710, Flight Pad Pro and PS5 controllers. You can find them in `/ahks`. Note that you have to replace the original `ffxi_directinput.ahk` with the corresponding script for it to work.

### Automatic SMN Crossbar switching (by Icydeath)
Added automatic crossbar switching for SMN. If there is a crossbar that has the same name as the avatar being casted (e.g. "ifrit"), it will automatically switch to that crossbar. When you use the Release command it will automatically switch back to the default crossbar.

### Superwarp Support (by Icydeath)
Added Superwarp macro creation. The screen allows you to pick either Survival guide or Home point areas. To use it, be sure to install the Superwarp Addon and enable the Run Plugin in Windower. In your `data/settings.xml`, you can set `enable_superwarp_all` to `true` to enable the `all` command when creating warp macros.

### Gearswap Macros (by FionaBrightgrass)
Added GearSwap Macros. To add a gearswap macro, go to your Gearswap set and add the sets: `sets.gsmacro1` through `sets.gsmacro8`:
```lua
sets.gsmacro1 = {ring1 = "Facility Ring"}
```

Then go to XIVCrossBar's `resources/crossbar_abilities.lua` and set the icons:
```lua
["gsmacro1"] = { id = 1550, en = "gsmacro1", res_key = "macros", type = "gs", category = "ready", element = "Light", default_icon = "/images/icons/weapons/katana.png", custom_icon = "weaponskills/katana/zesho-meppo.png", mp_cost = 0, tp_cost = 0},
-- ...
["gsmacro8"] = { id = 1557, en = "gsmacro8", res_key = "macros", type = "gs", category = "ready", element = "Light", default_icon = "/images/icons/weapons/katana.png", custom_icon = "weaponskills/katana/zesho-meppo.png", mp_cost = 0, tp_cost = 0},
```

Finally open "XIVCrossBar\data\hotbar\SERVER\CHARACTER\Job-Subjob.Lua"
To set `Slot4` to `gsmacro1`, adjust it as follows: 
```xml
<slot_4>  
    <target>me</target>  
    <type>gs</type>  
    <action>gsmacro1</action>  
    <alias>CallThisAnythingUWant</alias>  
</slot_4>
```  
  
To add a cycle macro for Gearswap, follow this structure:  
```xml
<slot_4>
    <target>me</target>
    <type>gsc</type>
    <action>offenseMode</action>
    <alias>Offense Mode</alias>
</slot_4>
```

```lua
["cycle"] = { id = 1550, en = "offenseMode", res_key = "macros", type = "gsc", category = "ready", element = "Light", default_icon = "/images/icons/weapons/katana.png", custom_icon = "weaponskills/katana/zesho-meppo.png", mp_cost = 0, tp_cost = 0},
-- ...
["cycle8"] = { id = 1557, en = "defenseMode", res_key = "macros", type = "gsc", category = "ready", element = "Light", default_icon = "/images/icons/weapons/katana.png", custom_icon = "weaponskills/katana/zesho-meppo.png", mp_cost = 0, tp_cost = 0},
```

## Contributing new / better Icons
XIVCrossbar has an amazing set of icons already, however, there are plenty of abilities and spells that could benefit from better looking ones. If you want to contribute some (e.g. by taking icons from FFXIV's crossbar), take a look at `resources/crossbar_abilities.lua` and `resources/crossbar_spells.lua`. E.g., the entry for Afflatus Misery states a custom icon path that says: `custom_icon = "abilities/afflatus-misery.png"`. That means, if you want to provide a better icon for it, place it here: `images/icons/iconpacks/default/abilities/afflactus-misery.png`. Note that all custom icons should be 40 x 40 px. If you have icons to contribute, please open up a Pull Request to share them with everyone!

### Identifiers

Manual hiding affects the crossbar display, not action dispatch. Explicit
`ui show` overrides cutscene hiding; `ui auto` restores automatic cutscene hiding.
Unlocking reveals an automatic OnInput crossbar but respects an explicit Hide.
Hidden crossbars cannot be dragged. None of these commands changes hotbar XML.
Saved scaling uses `Style.Scale` and `Menu.Scale`; aliases use
`Texts.SlotAlias.OffsetX/OffsetY`, independently of cost and recast text.
Drag offsets remain screen pixels at every scale. Existing character settings
continue to override defaults. Menu navigation workflows are unchanged in this batch.

- **Hotbars**: `l`, `r`, `rl`, `lr`, `ll`, `rr` (or `1`–`6`) - order in which you hit the triggers
- **Slots**: `ll`, `ld`, `lr`, `lu`, `rl`, `rd`, `rr`, `ru` (or `1`–`8`) - holding L/R trigger, then what direction dpad or face button you press

Reserved set names (cannot be renamed or deleted): `default`, `job-default`, `all-jobs-default`, `shared`.

---

## Notes

- The addon unbinds `Ctrl+F1` through `Ctrl+F12` because it uses those as gamepad proxies. `Alt`, `Shift`, or unmodified `F-1` through `F-12` bindings are unaffected. `Ctrl` is used (rather than `Alt`) because `Alt` has a tendency to get stuck on `Alt-Tab`. You can re-add your own `Ctrl+F1` through `Ctrl+F8` bindings by editing `function_key_bindings.lua`.
- D-pad inputs can only be captured by the addon when at least one trigger is held — without that, FFXI consumes them directly. This is mainly noticeable when navigating the action binder.
- All addon configuration is per-character. Hotbar XMLs live under `data/hotbar/<server>/<character>/`. CustomActions, Shared and SharedIcons XMLs are also here.

### Known issues

- **Phantom d-pad presses (rare)** — sometimes pressing a face button resulted in firing the equivalent direction on the d-pad (I.e., trying to use slot_rd would end up sending slot_ld). This was happening before I started making changes, but I could never consistently trigger it. The ahk script `ffxi_xinput_diagnostic.ahk` was made for that, to capture events. Not in use by default.

### Controller extras — October 5 live test

The root DirectInput and XInput wrappers now include `controller_extras.ahk`.
Keep that file and `controller-extras.ini` beside them. Existing launch settings
choose the wrapper; exit older experiment wrappers before loading this build.
L3 arms on press and cycles FFXI windows on release. Holding a trigger/menu,
pressing a modifier or changing focus cancels the switch. R3 remains native Run.
R1 sends Tab and L1 sends Shift+Tab once per press, with a 40ms explicit hold.
This targeting retry needs live validation; set `ShouldersEnabled=0` to disable
it. Set `L3Enabled=0` to disable switching, then restart the active wrapper.
DirectInput uses configurable Joy numbers; XInput uses native button masks. The
addon logs its selected wrapper at load. For a DualSense using DirectInput,
check that it says **DirectInput**; an XInput wrapper will not read its raw Joy
buttons. R1's old DirectInput F8 hotkey has been removed so it cannot fire
alongside Tab. Test L1/R1 with the FFXI window focused, both triggers released,
and no other wrapper running.

Build .4 includes centered aliases, the right-side Drag tile, pixel-thick
outlines, temporary scale preview, removed default-set notice and Save-first
review with safe action-type paging. Start alias centering tests with
`//xb ui aliasoffset 0 0`, then apply your preferred adjustments.

On build .5, L2 pages backward and R2 forward while browsing, including custom-action review. During button assignment, triggers still select crossbars. If both wrapper flags are on, DirectInput takes precedence to avoid duplicate inputs.
