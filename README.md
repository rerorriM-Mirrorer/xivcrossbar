# XIVCrossbar — Apps-key public release candidate

Based on qEagleStrikerp's consolidated XIVCrossbar repository, with updates by A.

## What this update addresses

- Native macro palettes no longer appear when using crossbars in Apps mode.
- D-pad and face buttons navigate the addon menu or execute a bound action without
  also moving the in-game menu (when duplicate native assignments are disabled).
- Ordinary keyboard F-keys and Ctrl+F-key shortcuts remain available.
- Crossbars can be scaled, dragged and hidden without disabling bindings. Menus
  fit the screen independently, including smaller resolutions.
- Custom actions use one review screen, with inline editing and name/alias fallbacks.
- Item icons, Superwarp bindings, draft navigation, chat messages and XML
  read/write safeguards received fixes developed during testing.

## Important: gamepad configuration

In **FINAL FANTASY XI GAMEPAD Config**, disable **hat switches** and duplicate D-pad, face-button and trigger assignments
as shown below. The addon supplies those buttons through AutoHotkey. Retain stick movement and camera controls.

The screenshot shows the tested PS5 DirectInput setup, with native XInput disabled.
All gamepad functions (like Ctrl and Alt macro keys) can stay assigned to other buttons; but avoid assigning them
to L2/R2 and the face buttons used for XIVCrossbar. The yellow markings identify that distinction.

## Controls

Apps+F1–F12 are reserved for controller input. Follow the setup
wizard to assign functions to face buttons.
On PlayStation 5 controllers:

- Share exits addon menus
- Keyboard Escape exits the full addon menu, including text fields and overlays
- Options opens the crossbar chooser, including over a custom-action draft.
- Triggers select crossbar slots or turn pages where the addon menu permits it.

For in-game D-pad targeting, use the command **`//xb dpad ijkl`**. This sends I/J/K/L for bare
Up/Left/Down/Right. In FFXI, go to **Config > Misc. 2 > Key Assignment > Movement**
and move I/J/K/L from **Menu Cursor & Camera** to **Menu/Target Cursor**, as shown:

![Four-step navigation and final IJKL targeting assignments](images/setup/ffxi-ijkl-targeting.png)

`//xb dpad arrows` restores arrow output; bare `//xb dpad` toggles between the two modes.

## Appearance and visibility

Drag a visible crossbar with the left mouse button; release saves its position.
Dragging also works while addon menus are open.

`AutoHideExtraBars` defaults to true: extra double-tap crossbars stay hidden until activated.

- `//xb autohide [on|off]`: show crossbars with trigger input; bare command toggles.
- `//xb fade [on|off]`: enable or disable regular crossbar fading; bare command toggles.
- `//xb scale <number>`: change crossbar scale, from 0.25 to 2. Menus keep their own layout.
- `//xb hide`, `//xb show`, `//xb auto`: manually hide, show continuously, or use autohide.
  Bindings remain active in each mode.

Defaults for fading in and out are **FadeIn 0.1s, FadeOut 0.5s, LoadFadeIn 2s**, adjustable in the `data/settings.xml`; existing saved values are preserved. Compact layout, themes, fonts and animation durations can also be changed in
`data/settings.xml`. Reload the addon after manual edits.

Startup uses LoadFadeIn even when regular fades are off. A trigger interrupts the
intro with the quick FadeIn when fades are on, or immediate full visibility when
fades are off. After startup, normal visibility settings resume.

## Custom actions

Use `//xb ca` to create a new custom action. `//xb ca <name>` also works; for example,  `//xb ca "Bow"` opens a creation screen with the Name already set to Bow, OR edits the existing action with that name.

Select Edit Name, Edit Alias or Edit Command to type directly into the review; then choose Save Only or Save & Bind.
Enter commits the active text field; Circle cancels it.

While the review is open, you can also edit fields with these commands:

| Field | Purpose | Command alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Unique name in the custom-action catalog | `//xb ca name <value>` — or `//xb ca n <value>` |
| Alias | Label displayed on the crossbar slot | `//xb ca alias <value>` — or `//xb ca a <value>` |
| Command | Windower console command to execute | `//xb ca command <value>` — or `//xb ca c <value>` |

Blank Alias defaults to Name. Blank Command defaults to Alias, then Name. If Bow
is already a Windower alias, an action named Bow can execute it without an explicit
Command.

For commands containing semicolons, type into the inline Command field to avoid
chat/console command splitting. Options can change the destination crossbar
without discarding your draft.

`//xb ca new <name>` remains available for names that would otherwise
be read as field commands.

## Help

`//xb help` lists commands, including the retained set/copy/move/icon/alias commands.
`//xb status` reports the version and configuration.
`//xb reload` refreshes crossbar data.
`//xb restart` closes menus and fades out before reloading the entire addon.
`//lua r xivcrossbar` performs the same full reload immediately.
Superwarp bindings require the separate Superwarp addon.

## Install or upgrade

Requires **Windower 4** and **AutoHotkey v1.1.33 or newer in the v1 series**,
associated with `.ahk` files.

1. Stop your current AutoHotkey controller script and unload XIVCrossbar on all clients.
2. Back up the existing `addons/xivcrossbar` folder, then move it out of the addons folder.
3. Extract the complete new `xivcrossbar` folder into Windower's `addons` folder.
4. To keep your settings and bindings, copy `data/` and `config.ini` from your backup
   into the new folder. Restore any custom icons you added or replaced. Keep the
   new Lua and AutoHotkey files.
5. Load with `//lua l xivcrossbar`. A fresh installation opens setup: choose the
   input profile, then button artwork, then confirm the requested combinations.
   Existing mappings are retained; `//xb remap` reopens setup.
6. Test bare menu navigation and a trigger-held binding.

The shared AutoHotkey script starts automatically. Unloading one client leaves it
running for the others.
`//xb controller stop` stops it for all clients; `//xb controller start` restarts it. Ctrl+Alt+F12 also exits this script.
To roll back, stop the script, unload on all clients and restore your backed-up
folder. Keep a separate copy of any newer bindings you want to retain.

## Controller profiles

Choose a profile during setup, or change it with a command such as
**`//xb controller profile ps5`**. The addon stops and restarts the shared script
automatically. Release the buttons before resuming play. Use the same profile
across clients sharing a controller.

| Profile command | Controller mapping | Test status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ps5` | PS5 DirectInput | Default; tested in game |
| `f710` | Logitech F710 DirectInput | Experimental |
| `fightpadpro` | FightPadPro DirectInput | Experimental |
| `xinput` | Xbox-style XInput; Start opens the chooser | Experimental |
| `xinputalt` | XInput; R1 opens the chooser instead of Start | Experimental |

The profile selects how the script reads the controller; the button artwork selection in the setup wizard only selects the labels shown by the addon. The first four profiles are offered in setup;
`xinputalt` is available through its command.

`//xb controller profiles` lists choices.
`//xb controller status` reports the selected and running profiles.
If needed, an optional device number selects which controller to read: `//xb controller profile xinput 2`. Omit it to use device 1.
